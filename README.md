### About Author
- Sharon Curley
  
    My role is a Business Systems Analyst for [Meissner Corporation](https://www.meissner.com/) - a manufacturing company in Castlebar, Co. Mayo. The systems I am supporting currently are Microsoft Dynamics 365 (ERP) for all Meissner entities (Ireland, US, Switzerland, Germany & Italy). I initially started out in functional areas like Customer Service & Supply Chain as I was lucky to be one of the first crew members on board in this company in 2020. I have moved into the IT Dept since March last year. I have a background in SAP - projects & support, so was drawn back into this area when I saw the opportunity arise within Meissner. I have a keen interest in data as when I was a functional user that was the most challenging part of my role - trying to get meaningful data from the systems we use. I have used excel to an advanced level and started with Power BI. I see a lot of opportunities within Meissner to develop in the Data field. I am hoping I will have the skills to do so.
